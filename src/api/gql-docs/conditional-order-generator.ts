'flash_loan_helper' = Aave V3 adapter (FACTORY() introspection via settlement handler); 'cowshed_proxy' = CoWShed smart wallet proxy; null = direct EOA, or Aave adapter whose mapping has not yet been discovered (backfilled on first settlement).

Derived from the handler address. decodedParams is populated for every value except Unknown (see decodeError for the failure case). Shapes for TWAP, StopLoss, PerpetualSwap, GoodAfterTime, and TradeAboveThreshold are documented in docs/supported-order-types.md; shapes for CirclesBackingOrder, SwapOrderHandler, and ERC4626CowSwapFeeBurner are defined by the decoders in src/decoders/. Unknown and CowAmmConstantProduct generators are stored for completeness, but their discrete-order history is not backfilled.",

    "Incremental-sync cursor: the indexer's processing block of the last client-relevant change, not the original on-chain event block. Generator inserts, status changes, child discrete-order changes, and new candidates update this cursor. UID precomputation also updates it when it sets allCandidatesKnown. Internal polling fields do not independently update it. Fetch full history once. Keep one cursor per chainId. Poll with updatedAtBlock_gte (inclusive), filtered by owner OR resolvedOwner. Merge generators by (chainId, eventId). Fetch all partOrders pages for changed generators with chainId and conditionalOrderGeneratorId_in. Merge parts by (chainId, orderUid). partOrders includes candidates but has no per-part update cursor. Reorgs can restore database rows at blocks earlier than the client cursor, so a cached view can miss changes. Older Aave-adapter generators can retain the adapter as resolvedOwner. An owner-filtered sync only receives them after their next cursor update.",
