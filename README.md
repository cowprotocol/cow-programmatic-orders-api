# Programmatic Orders API

Indexes on-chain events from [CoW Protocol](https://cow.fi)'s ComposableCoW contract, decodes the programmatic order types the indexer supports (see [`src/decoders/`](./src/decoders/) for the canonical list), and serves the data through a GraphQL API. Built with [Ponder](https://ponder.sh) by [@bleu](https://github.com/bleu) and maintained by CoW Protocol.

## Tech stack

- [Ponder](https://ponder.sh) 0.16.x -- blockchain indexing framework
- TypeScript
- [viem](https://viem.sh) -- Ethereum interactions and ABI encoding
- [Hono](https://hono.dev) -- API routing
- PostgreSQL

## Quick start

Requires Node.js >= 18.14, [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/), and Docker.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:cowprotocol/cow-programmatic-orders-api.git
cd cow-programmatic-orders-api
pnpm install
```

Copy the env file and configure your RPC endpoints:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Open `.env.local` and set `MAINNET_RPC_URL` and `GNOSIS_RPC_URL`. Optionally set `<CHAIN>_WS_RPC_URL` (e.g. `MAINNET_WS_RPC_URL`) to enable Ponder realtime WS subscriptions, which are more efficient than HTTP polling.

Start PostgreSQL and run the indexer:

```bash
docker compose up -d
pnpm dev
```

The GraphQL API is at `http://localhost:42069` once the dev server starts.

> **First run takes time.** The indexer must backfill all on-chain events from the contract's deploy block before it goes live. This can take several hours depending on your RPC endpoint. The API is queryable the whole time — data just fills in progressively.

## Is it working?

Use these endpoints to check indexer health without reading logs:

| Endpoint | What to expect |
|----------|----------------|
| `GET /healthz` | `200 {"status":"ok"}` — process is alive |
| `GET /ready` | `503` while backfilling, `200` once caught up |
| `GET /status` | Per-chain block progress (current vs. latest) |
| `GET /metrics` | Prometheus metrics (block lag, handler latency) |

**Normal during backfill** — `/ready` returns `503` and `/status` shows `checkpoint` far behind `latest`. The indexer is working; it just hasn't caught up yet. Expect this for several hours on first run.

**Stuck vs. slow** — if `/status` shows the same `checkpoint` block for more than 5 minutes _after_ backfill (i.e., once `/ready` returned `200`), the indexer may be stuck. Check `docker logs <container>` for errors.

**Container crashed** — `/healthz` returns a connection error. Restart the container and check logs.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `pnpm dev` | Start the indexer in dev mode |
| `pnpm start` | Start in production mode |
| `pnpm codegen` | Regenerate types after config or schema changes |
| `pnpm typecheck` | Run TypeScript type checking |
| `pnpm lint` | Run ESLint |
| `pnpm test` | Run tests |
