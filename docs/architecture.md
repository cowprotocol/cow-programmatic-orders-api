# System Architecture

This document covers how the indexer works, from on-chain events to the GraphQL API. It's meant for developers who will maintain and extend this codebase.

## Overview

The system is a Ponder 0.16.x indexer that watches the ComposableCoW contract on all active chains (see `ponder.config.ts`). When a user creates a programmatic order (TWAP, Stop Loss, etc.), the contract emits a `ConditionalOrderCreated` event. The indexer picks that up, decodes the order parameters, resolves the actual owner (which may be behind a proxy), and writes the result to Postgres. A Hono HTTP server exposes the data through GraphQL and a SQL passthrough endpoint.

Ponder registers handlers for three independent on-chain event streams: `ComposableCow` (conditional order creation), `CoWShedFactory` (proxy wallet deployment), and `GPv2Settlement` (Aave adapter detection via `Settlement` events — `Trade` logs in the receipt identify the adapter address). During live sync, additional block handlers in `src/application/handlers/block/` (one file per handler) poll contract state and the CoW orderbook API. See that directory for the current handler list and responsibilities. `settlement.ts` detects Aave flash loan adapters and records the flash-loan orders they settle: the `GPv2Settlement:Settlement` event handler does all RPC work inline (each call wrapped in `withTimeout` with its own try/catch, so errors never crash the handler), writing both an `ownerMapping` row and a `flashLoanOrder` row per confirmed adapter.

## Contracts and Chains

Configuration lives in `src/chains/` (one file per chain). The ComposableCoW contract is deployed at the same CREATE2 address on every chain (`0xfdaFc9d1902f4e0b84f65F49f244b32b31013b74`), so each chain config only needs to specify the start block per chain.

Currently active chains, their start blocks, and contract addresses are defined in `src/chains/`. To add a chain, create a chain file there and register it in `src/chains/index.ts`.

Stub configs exist for all 12 chains in cow-sdk's `ALL_SUPPORTED_CHAIN_IDS`; contract addresses for the remaining chains need verification before enabling.

`ponder.config.ts` derives all config from `ACTIVE_CHAINS` in `src/chains/index.ts` and wires it into Ponder's `createConfig`. It never contains raw addresses or block numbers directly. It also registers the live-only block handlers in [`src/application/handlers/block/`](../src/application/handlers/block/) (one file per handler; `blockHandler.ts` is a barrel that imports them) — all run during live sync only (`startBlock: "latest"`).


Three contracts are indexed:

1. **ComposableCow** -- the main contract. Emits `ConditionalOrderCreated` for new programmatic orders.
2. **CoWShedFactory** -- emits `COWShedBuilt` when a user deploys a CoWShed proxy wallet. On Gnosis there are two factory addresses (the current `CoWShedForComposableCoW` factory and a legacy `COWShed` factory), both indexed through a single Ponder contract entry using an address array.
3. **GPv2Settlement** -- the CoW Protocol settlement contract. Filtered to only `Settlement` events where the solver is the FlashLoanRouter address, so the volume is very low.

## Data Flow

Three independent on-chain event streams feed into the same schema tables and are then served by the API layer:

## Schema

The following tables, defined in `schema/tables.ts`. All use composite primary keys with `chainId` as the first column, which is necessary for multi-chain support and prevents collisions between chains.

### transaction

Stores block metadata for each transaction the indexer processes. Multiple events in the same transaction share a row; inserts use `onConflictDoNothing`.

Columns: `hash`, `chainId`, `blockNumber`, `blockTimestamp`.
PK: `(chainId, hash)`.

### conditional_order_generator

The main table. One row per `ConditionalOrderCreated` event. Stores the raw order params, the decoded params (as JSON), and the resolved owner.

Key columns:
- `eventId` -- Ponder's event ID, used as the entity identifier
- `owner` -- the address from the event (could be a proxy)
- `resolvedOwner` -- EOA from `ownerMapping` when `owner` already has a row at insert time; otherwise the same as `owner`. Not rewritten when a new `owner_mapping` row is added later.
- `handler` -- the IConditionalOrder handler contract address
- `hash` -- keccak256 of the ABI-encoded params tuple (handler, salt, staticInput). This is what `singleOrders(owner, hash)` checks on-chain.
- `orderType` -- one of TWAP, StopLoss, PerpetualSwap, GoodAfterTime, TradeAboveThreshold, CirclesBackingOrder, SwapOrderHandler, ERC4626CowSwapFeeBurner, or Unknown
- `decodedParams` -- JSON blob with the decoded staticInput fields, or null if decode failed
- `decodeError` -- set to `"invalid_static_input"` if decoding threw, otherwise null
- `status` -- Active, Cancelled, or Completed

PK: `(chainId, eventId)`. Indexed on `owner`, `handler`, `hash`, `chainId+owner`, and `resolvedOwner`.

### discrete_order

Links individual order UIDs (from the CoW Protocol orderbook) back to their parent generator. One generator can produce many discrete orders over its lifetime — a TWAP with 10 parts creates 10 discrete orders. Populated by CandidateConfirmer after confirmation against the orderbook API; status kept current by OrderStatusTracker.

Key columns: `orderUid`, `chainId`, `conditionalOrderGeneratorId` (references `eventId`), `status` (open/fulfilled/unfilled/expired/cancelled), `sellAmount`, `buyAmount`, `executedSellAmount`, `executedBuyAmount`.
PK: `(chainId, orderUid)`. See [api-reference.md](./api-reference.md) for full field docs.

### candidate_discrete_order

**Why candidate orders?** The CoW watch-tower submits orders to the orderbook API on behalf of generators. There is a gap between when the indexer discovers a valid order UID (via `getTradeableOrderWithSignature` or precompute) and when it actually appears in the orderbook API (after the watch-tower posts it). Storing candidates immediately lets the indexer track all UIDs it knows about, confirm them against the API in a later block, and avoid polling the API for UIDs that haven't been posted yet. Without this staging table, the indexer would either poll the API every block for every possible UID (expensive), or miss orders entirely.

Staging rows for discrete orders discovered by `OrderDiscoveryPoller` (`getTradeableOrderWithSignature`) or precomputed at creation time before the orderbook API lists them. When `CandidateConfirmer` confirms a UID against the API, the row is promoted to `discrete_order` and removed from candidates. Stale candidates (past `validTo`) are pruned on each `CandidateConfirmer` block.

Key columns: `orderUid`, `chainId`, `conditionalOrderGeneratorId`, amounts, `validTo`, `creationDate`, `possibleValidAfterTimestamp` (TWAP scheduling). PK: `(chainId, orderUid)`.

### owner_mapping

Maps proxy/helper contract addresses to the actual owner EOA. Two types of proxies exist:

- `cowshed_proxy` -- CoWShed smart wallet proxy, mapped when the CoWShedFactory emits `COWShedBuilt`
- `flash_loan_helper` -- Aave V3 adapter contract, mapped when the settlement handler detects it through FACTORY() introspection

Columns: `address`, `chainId`, `owner`, `addressType`, `txHash`, `blockNumber`, `resolutionDepth`.
PK: `(chainId, address)`.

The `resolutionDepth` column records how many hops were needed to reach the EOA. For CoWShed proxies it's 0 (the `COWShedBuilt` event directly provides the user). For Aave adapters it's 1 (call `owner()` on the adapter to get the EOA).

### flash_loan_order

Standalone CoW orders settled by an Aave V3 flash-loan adapter — **not** ComposableCoW conditional orders (no generator, no `staticInput`). Recorded executed-only from the on-chain `Trade` event at settlement; there is **no `status` column** (presence means executed). Each adapter is a fresh CREATE2 deployment per order, so adapter ↔ order is 1:1.

Columns: `orderUid`, `chainId`, `adapter`, `sellToken`, `buyToken`, `executedSellAmount`, `executedBuyAmount`, `feeAmount`, `txHash`, `blockNumber`, `blockTimestamp` (from the `Trade` event); `validTo` (decoded from the order UID); `owner` (resolved EOA, from the adapter's `owner()` call); `receiver`, `kind`, `sellAmountIntended`, `buyAmountIntended` (nullable, filled from the orderbook by `FlashLoanOrderEnricher`); `source` (`"aave"`); `type` (nullable: `RepayWithCollateral` / `CollateralSwap` / `DebtSwap`); `enrichedAt` (block time enrichment succeeded; null = pending) and `enrichmentAttempts` (retry counter).
PK: `(chainId, orderUid)`. Indexes on `owner`, `adapter`, and `(chainId, enrichedAt, blockNumber)` (the enricher poll query). Relations: `transaction`, `ownerMapping` (via `adapter`).

See [supported-order-types.md](./supported-order-types.md#aave-flash-loan-orders) for the full flow (type detection, orderbook enrichment).

## Handlers in Detail

### composableCow.ts -- ConditionalOrderCreated

This is the primary event handler. When a `ConditionalOrderCreated` fires:

1. ABI-encode the params tuple `(handler, salt, staticInput)` and hash it with keccak256. This hash matches what the on-chain `singleOrders` mapping uses.

2. Look up the `owner` address in `ownerMapping`. If there's a match (e.g. a known CoWShed proxy), use the mapped EOA as `resolvedOwner`. If no match exists, `resolvedOwner` is set to `owner`. For Aave adapters there is often no row yet at insert time; settlement may later insert `owner_mapping` for the adapter, but existing `conditional_order_generator` rows are not updated—queries and REST endpoints use `owner_mapping` (e.g. `/api/orders/by-owner`) to resolve EOAs.

3. Identify the order type by looking up the handler address in a map (`src/utils/order-types.ts`). The handler addresses are the same across all chains. If the handler isn't recognized, the order is stored as `Unknown`.

4. Decode the `staticInput` bytes using the appropriate decoder from `src/decoders/`. Each order type has its own decoder that unpacks the ABI-encoded struct into typed fields. BigInts are converted to strings before storing as JSON (Ponder's `replaceBigInts`). If decoding fails, `decodeError` is set and `decodedParams` is null.

5. Insert the `transaction` and `conditionalOrderGenerator` rows, both with `onConflictDoNothing` for idempotency.

### cowshed.ts -- COWShedBuilt

When a CoWShed proxy wallet is deployed, this handler stores the mapping from the proxy address (`shed`) to the deploying user address in `ownerMapping`. This mapping is then available for the composableCow handler to resolve owners.

### settlement.ts -- Flash Loan Adapter Detection + Order Recording

This file detects Aave V3 flash loan adapter contracts and records the flash-loan orders they settle. The GPv2Settlement contract is filtered (in `ponder.config.ts`) to only index settlements from the FlashLoanRouter solver, so the event volume is very low. All RPC work runs **inline** in the `GPv2Settlement:Settlement` event handler, each call wrapped in `withTimeout(...)` with its own try/catch so a failed fetch skips the settlement without crashing the indexer.

When a Settlement event fires:

1. Fetch the full transaction receipt (with timeout). On error, log a warning and return.
2. Iterate the receipt logs; keep only `Trade` logs emitted by the GPv2Settlement contract.
3. Extract the adapter address from the indexed `owner` topic.
4. Skip if already in `ownerMapping` (adapter seen in a prior settlement — safe because adapter ↔ order is 1:1, so no order is ever dropped).
5. Call `getCode` on the address (with timeout). Skip if EOA (no bytecode).
6. Call `FACTORY()` via raw `eth_call` (not `readContract`, which logs a WARN on every revert). If the returned address doesn't match the known AaveV3AdapterFactory address, skip.

Once the adapter is confirmed, this branch records the **order** as well as the mapping:

7. Decode the non-indexed `Trade` log data (tokens, executed amounts, fee, `orderUid`) that step 3 discarded, and decode `validTo` from the trailing `uint32` of the `orderUid`.
8. Derive `type` from the adapter's EIP-1167 implementation address (extracted from the step-5 `getCode` bytecode — no extra RPC).
9. Call `owner()` on the adapter to resolve the EOA. Unlike the adapter's `getHookData()` struct (which is wiped in the settlement tx, so reads after settlement return zeros), `owner()` is durable on-chain state.
10. Insert `transaction` and `flashLoanOrder` (always, `onConflictDoNothing` on `chainId + orderUid`) with the on-chain fields plus the resolved `owner`; the orderbook fields (`receiver`, `kind`, intended amounts) start `null` and `enrichedAt` is `null`. Insert `ownerMapping` (`addressType = FlashLoanHelper`, `resolutionDepth = 1`) whenever the EOA resolved.

The orderbook-sourced fields are filled later by `FlashLoanOrderEnricher` (see below) — the adapter does not retain them on-chain.

The raw `eth_call` for `FACTORY()` avoids Ponder's built-in WARN logs on reverts — most addresses are not Aave adapters, so reverts are the common case and would flood the logs if `readContract` were used.

Stats (total settlements, trade logs found, EOA skips, adapter mappings, avg FACTORY() latency) are accumulated and logged every 30 seconds.

### block/ -- live block handlers

The block handlers live in `src/application/handlers/block/` (one file per handler); `blockHandler.ts` is a thin barrel that imports them so their `ponder.on(...)` registrations run. All run during live sync (`startBlock: "latest"`), which keeps their orderbook API calls off the critical path to the tip — including **OwnerBackfillLive**, which drains owner history from the tip onward. `OrderDiscoveryPoller` and `CancellationWatcher` share a per-chain batch cap (`MAX_GENERATORS_PER_BLOCK_<chainId>`, default 200) and pull from a priority queue ordered by oldest `lastCheckBlock` first. Generators past the cap defer to the next block.

**OrderDiscoveryPoller** (every block, all active chains): Multicalls `getTradeableOrderWithSignature` on ComposableCoW for each `Active` generator where `allCandidatesKnown=false`. A success result creates a `candidateDiscreteOrder` entry. A `SingleOrderNotAuthed` error marks the generator as `Cancelled` with `lastPollResult='cancelled:SingleOrderNotAuthed'`. Other errors (tryNextBlock, tryAtEpoch, etc.) advance the generator's `nextCheckBlock` accordingly. Single-shot non-deterministic types (GoodAfterTime, TradeAboveThreshold) set `allCandidatesKnown=true` after first success.

**CandidateConfirmer** (every block, all active chains): First drains any `candidateDiscreteOrder` rows whose parent generator is `Cancelled` — promoting them into `discreteOrder` with `status='cancelled'` and deleting the candidate rows. Then checks remaining `candidateDiscreteOrder` rows against the orderbook API: when a candidate appears in the API, it's promoted to `discreteOrder` and deleted from candidates. Candidates past their `validTo` are also pruned.

**TWAP aged-out fallback**: When a candidate's `orderUid` is no longer served by `/orders/by_uids` (typically after the order expires from the orderbook cache), `CandidateConfirmer` falls back to fetching the owner's full order list from `/account/{owner}/orders`. This resolves TWAP parts that the orderbook stopped tracking before `CandidateConfirmer` processed them. On timeout or API failure, the candidate defaults to `expired`.

**OrderStatusTracker** (every block, all active chains): Polls the orderbook API for all `open` discrete orders and updates their status from the API response. Then sweeps any remaining `open` rows whose parent generator is `Cancelled` to `status='cancelled'` (API-terminal statuses from the loop above still win for children that were traded before on-chain cancellation). Finally expires any orders past their `validTo` timestamp.

**FlashLoanOrderBackfiller** (fires once at latest block, all active chains): The flash-loan enrichment counterpart of `OwnerBackfillLive`. The settlement handler records `flashLoanOrder` rows with on-chain data only (the adapter's `getHookData()` struct is wiped at settlement, so the orderbook is the source of truth for `receiver`/`kind`/intended amounts). Enrichment is **not** done in the historical path — instead this one-shot handler bulk-drains the entire backlog (`enrichedAt IS NULL`) at go-live, in bounded sequential slices of `FLASH_LOAN_BACKFILL_SLICE_SIZE` (500) to cap orderbook concurrency. Doing the whole drain in a single firing keeps the post-promotion incomplete-data window to roughly one firing rather than hours.

**FlashLoanOrderEnricher** (every block, all active chains): Steady-state enrichment for orders that settle *during* live sync, plus any stragglers the backfiller left (timeouts / not-yet-on-API). Selects pending rows (`enrichedAt IS NULL`, oldest `blockNumber` first) up to `MAX_FLASH_LOAN_ORDERS_PER_BLOCK_<chainId>` (default 200). Both handlers share one enrichment routine: batch-fetch via `/orders/by_uids` (cache-first against `cow_cache.order_uid_cache`, the shared per-UID cache, which survives reindex), upsert the orderbook fields + `enrichedAt` on hits, and bump `enrichmentAttempts` on misses until `MAX_FLASH_LOAN_ENRICHMENT_ATTEMPTS` (then left permanently un-enriched rather than polled forever).

**OwnerBackfillLive** (all active chains): Fetches historical orders for non-deterministic generators (the realtime poller only ever returns the *current* tradeable order, never past ones). It runs from `"latest"` onward (`startBlock: "latest"`, fine cadence), draining owner history once sync reaches the tip and keeping its orderbook I/O off the critical path there. Each firing drains a bounded batch of owners (`MAX_OWNERS_BACKFILL_PER_BLOCK_<chainId>`, default 20), picked least-recently-attempted first, so the drain spreads across blocks (rate-limit friendly) and no single transaction holds thousands of owners. Per-owner attempts are resumable slices: progress persists page-by-page in `cow_cache.owner_drain`, and a hard ~30s deadline cancels the in-flight request, so a whale owner advances every firing instead of restarting and can't block the queue.

Eligibility is gated on the `conditionalOrderGenerator.historyBackfilled` flag — **not** on "has no discrete orders yet" — so a generator the realtime poller already inserted rows for is still backfilled. `Unknown` and `CowAmmConstantProduct` generators are excluded entirely (`OWNER_BACKFILL_EXCLUDED` in `utils/order-types.ts`): they are stored, but never drained and never gate readiness — unknown handlers are unsupported, and CoW AMM migrated out of ComposableCoW. The flag is `true` at creation for generators that never need a drain (deterministic types, and generators created during live sync), and is flipped to `true` only after an owner's history is drained **in full** (a partial drain from rate-limit/timeout leaves the owner eligible → retried next block). Per owner it drains the full `/account/{owner}/orders` history at 1000/page. Because Ponder rebuilds onchain tables on every schema-hash redeploy, the full composable-order rows are kept in the durable `cow_cache.composable_order` table (survives reindex) and only the delta newer than `MAX(creation_date)` is fetched each deploy; the rows store the stable `generator_hash` and are re-mapped to the current generator `eventId` on read. Promotion readiness is gated on this drain completing — see `/readyz` in deployment.md.

**CancellationWatcher** (every block, all active chains): Closes `OrderDiscoveryPoller`'s blind spot. `OrderDiscoveryPoller` skips `allCandidatesKnown=true` generators, so removals via `ComposableCoW.remove()` on deterministic types (TWAP, StopLoss, CirclesBackingOrder) would otherwise go undetected — `remove()` emits no event. `CancellationWatcher` multicalls `singleOrders(owner, hash)` on a per-generator cadence of `DETERMINISTIC_CANCEL_SWEEP_INTERVAL` blocks (default 100). A `false` return means the owner called `remove()` on-chain: the generator is flipped to `Cancelled` with `lastPollResult='cancelled:removeMapping'`, after which `CandidateConfirmer` and `OrderStatusTracker`'s parent-cancelled cascades reconcile the children on the next block. `true` reschedules the next check.

## Order Types and Decoders

All order types supported by the indexer have a dedicated decoder in `src/decoders/` (see that directory for the current list). Two categories exist based on how UIDs are discovered:

- **Deterministic** (`allCandidatesKnown=true`): UIDs are precomputed at order creation time from the params alone, so all candidate UIDs are known immediately. Currently: TWAP, StopLoss, CirclesBackingOrder. Not polled by `OrderDiscoveryPoller`.
- **Non-deterministic** (`allCandidatesKnown=false`): UIDs depend on runtime state and cannot be precomputed, so they are polled every block by `OrderDiscoveryPoller`. The classification is the `DETERMINISTIC_ORDER_TYPE` record in [`utils/order-types.ts`](../src/utils/order-types.ts); `NON_DETERMINISTIC_TYPES` (its complement) is derived from it so the two never drift. `OWNER_BACKFILL_TYPES` (that set minus `OWNER_BACKFILL_EXCLUDED`, i.e. minus Unknown and CowAmmConstantProduct) is the single source for OwnerBackfillLive eligibility, the `/readyz` pending count, and the `historyBackfilled` creation-time flag.

The canonical list of decoded order types is `src/decoders/`; handler addresses (including per-chain overlays for newer handlers) are tracked in `src/utils/order-types.ts`.

When a handler address isn't recognized, the order is stored with type `Unknown` and null decoded params.

For handler addresses, Solidity struct layouts, and field-by-field decoding for each type, see [supported-order-types.md](./supported-order-types.md).

## Owner Resolution

Users interact with CoW Protocol through several layers of proxy contracts, so the `owner` field in a `ConditionalOrderCreated` event often isn't the actual human behind the order. The indexer resolves this using the `ownerMapping` table.

Two proxy patterns exist:

**CoWShed proxies**: CoWShed is a smart wallet system for CoW Protocol. When a user deploys a CoWShed proxy through the factory, the `COWShedBuilt` event provides the user address directly. The cowshed.ts handler writes this mapping as it sees factory events. Later, when a `ConditionalOrderCreated` fires with a CoWShed proxy as owner, the composableCow handler looks up the mapping and sets `resolvedOwner` to the actual user.

**Aave V3 flash loan adapters**: These are per-user proxy contracts created by the AaveV3AdapterFactory. They're trickier to detect because there's no factory event -- the adapter is just a contract that happens to trade through CoW Protocol. The settlement handler identifies them by checking whether a trade address implements `FACTORY()` returning the known AaveV3AdapterFactory address, then calls `owner()` to get the EOA.

CoWShed mappings are usually available before the conditional order is created. Aave adapter mappings may appear only after a settlement trade. The `resolvedOwner` column on `conditional_order_generator` is set once at insert and does not change when `owner_mapping` later gains a matching row; join `owner_mapping` or use owner-aware APIs for current proxy-to-EOA resolution.

## API Layer

`src/api/index.ts` is a Hono app. Routes:

- `/` and `/graphql` -- GraphQL endpoint, auto-generated by Ponder from the schema. Field descriptions are injected by `ponder-enrich-gql-docs-middleware` at runtime.
- `/sql/*` -- Ponder's SQL passthrough client for raw read-only SQL.
- `/api/*` -- custom REST endpoints (`src/api/router.ts`), defined with `@hono/zod-openapi`.
- `/docs` -- Swagger UI for the REST endpoints.
- `/healthz` -- returns `{"status": "ok"}`.

See [api-reference.md](./api-reference.md) for the full endpoint list.

## Adding a New Chain

1. Create `src/chains/<name>.ts` implementing the `ChainConfig` interface (use `src/chains/base.ts` as a template). Fill in confirmed contract addresses; leave `null` for any that aren't deployed yet.
2. Import and add the new chain to `ALL_DEFINED_CHAINS` in `src/chains/index.ts`.
3. When all required addresses are confirmed, add it to `ACTIVE_CHAINS` in the same file.
4. Add its RPC URL env var to `.env.local` and to the production deployment in the CoW infrastructure repository.
5. Run `pnpm codegen` to regenerate types.

## Known Limitations

- Cancellation detection has a small lag. For non-deterministic generators, `OrderDiscoveryPoller` catches `SingleOrderNotAuthed` on the next poll (every block). For deterministic generators, `CancellationWatcher` reads `singleOrders(owner, hash)` every `DETERMINISTIC_CANCEL_SWEEP_INTERVAL` blocks (default 100) — so on-chain removal is reflected with worst-case latency of ~100 blocks (minutes, scaling with the chain's block time). There is no on-chain event for `remove()`, so shorter detection latency would require a higher-cadence sweep. Once the generator is marked `Cancelled`, `CandidateConfirmer` and `OrderStatusTracker` cascade the state to children on the next block; the `CandidateConfirmer` cascade does a preflight `/by_uids` query so that candidates already on the orderbook get their actual status rather than defaulting to `cancelled`; API-terminal statuses (`fulfilled` / `unfilled` / `expired`) still win for children already promoted to `discrete_order`.

- **Orderbook `/by_uids` vs `/account` inconsistency (residual gap).** The CoW orderbook `POST /api/v1/orders/by_uids` endpoint drops UIDs whose orders have aged out of its active set, while `GET /api/v1/account/{owner}/orders` still returns them. The indexer polls `/by_uids` as its primary path and falls back to `/account/{owner}/orders` before deleting a stale candidate, but the fallback is bounded — `fetchOwnerOrderStatuses` caps pages at `maxPages` (default 3) in `orderbookClient.ts` — so an owner with very long order history may still have a residual gap, and the historical *backfill* precompute path does not use the fallback at all. The durable fix is upstream: CoW services should make `/by_uids` consistent with `/account/{owner}/orders` for terminal statuses.

- **Hand-rolled orderbook client.** `orderbookClient.ts` is a hand-rolled transport rather than the cow-sdk `OrderBookApi`. The SDK client offers no per-call `AbortSignal`/timeout (its `backOff` defaults to `numOfAttempts: 10, maxDelay: Infinity`, i.e. effectively unbounded), no `by_uids` batch method, and no custom-fetch seam — all of which are required for bounded I/O inside a per-block DB transaction (the timeout discipline the block handlers depend on). The indexer reuses the SDK's request/response *types* and URL catalog but keeps its own transport so every orderbook call has a hard timeout and bounded retry.
- Aave adapter owner resolution is reactive — `owner_mapping` is written when the adapter appears in settlement, which may be after the conditional order is created. The generator row keeps `resolvedOwner` equal to the adapter address when no mapping existed at insert time; that column is not backfilled when the mapping is inserted later. `ownerAddressType` on the generator IS backfilled when the mapping is inserted — after which GraphQL and REST filters on `ownerAddressType = "flash_loan_helper"` reflect the correct value. `resolvedOwner` is still not backfilled (set once at insert, unchanged thereafter).
